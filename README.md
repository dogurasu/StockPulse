### StockPulse is a React application built to interface AlphaVantage's Stock API

#### My Own Notes
 - **Use this stock API:** https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/
    - old API used https://finnhub.io/
 - **Plotly documentation:** https://plotly.com/javascript/react/
 - **Highcharts Docs:** https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-react#getting-started

 - **Stock component**
    - has state vals: stockChartXVals, stockChartYVals
    - has function 'componentDidMount' that calls stock API w/ Fetch 

## TODO ##
 - ~~create API connection with Alphavantage API~~
 - Create Component System
